# DanceDigitizerFrontend

for frontend, run npm install and then npm start, you'll need to add an mp4 file inside of the assets folder called sample3.mp4 and then for now change all the paths where the video path is used to where yours is

for backend, you'll need to install flask, librosa, moviepy, shutil, ffmeg and whatever else it might say

backend is server.py and will run on port 5001
